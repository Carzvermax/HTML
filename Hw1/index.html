    The Simpsons (often shortened to Simpsons) is an American animated sitcom created by Matt Groening for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The main characters are a satire of a working-class family, consisting of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. The series lampoons many aspects of American culture, society, politics, and history.

    The cartoon made its debut as 60-second animated bumpers for The Tracey Ullman Show, with the first short airing on April 19, 1987. The shorts were then expanded into a full-length 30-minute television spin-off by 20th Century Fox, first airing on December 17, 1989. As of 2021, 33 seasons have aired, with the 34th airing since September 25.

    The series currently holds the record for the longest-running prime-time sitcom in the US, running for 32 years and 34 seasons, as well as three seasons of shorts since 1989, and becoming the longest-running program on FOX.
